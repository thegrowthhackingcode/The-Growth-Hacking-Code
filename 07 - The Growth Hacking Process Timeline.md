It’s now time to put the pieces together in a smooth process. In order for you and your team to relax into this easily, I have broken down the process into months and weeks. This way, you can work through it like a checklist and be sure you’re avoiding unnecessary mistakes.

# Month 0
We call this Month 0, because this is the base work and it’s not guaranteed that this will take one month. Do not set a deadline at which this must be finished. Instead, set a date monthly at which point is evaluated whether the process is finished. Decide on the Level that you want to reach (see below) depending on the amount of time and resources you can spare for building out your Growth Hacking Process. The minimum requirements for getting started with Month 1 is Level I.

## Get Data Tracking On Point
Bring together heads of marketing, sales and product, as well as the CEO and define KPIs for each department. Set up proper data tracking for each department and display them transparently in consolidated dashboards. All data needs to communicate with each other and cross-functional data needs to be correlated.

**Level I:** Everything is somewhat tracked. This is the minimum requirement.

**Level II:** (in addition to Level I) Data is somewhat correlated in some places and some Dashboards exist. Maybe, some company KPIs are reported/calculated.

**Level III:** (in addition to Level II) All data is consolidated in one place. This can be in addition to keeping data in the places that it is sourced. All data is displayed in Dashboards and the relevant company KPIs are visible to everyone in one place. All cross-functional data is correlated.

It is up to you how far you want to take this, but the core KPIs of your funnel will build on top of the awareness created within this first process. A team that is aware of data is a team that will fully comprehend and be able to act upon the metrics of the growth funnel.
