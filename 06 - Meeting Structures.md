# Growth Meeting
Here’s the agenda for a Growth Meeting, as proposed by Sean Ellis and adapted/expanded by me.

1. Each Growth Team member **nominates 2 ideas**, of which only 1 can be their own. They get *30 seconds to pitch each idea to the rest of the team*. The prioritization within the idea backlog makes this very easy.
2. All team members *agree on the experiments to be set up in that week*. Look to the Process Timeline for the recommended number of experiments to be carried out in each phase of the Growth Hacking Process. Make sure you account for the resources in each department.
3. Share (Channel) Research Task findings and ideation completed by the respective Growth Team member who’s deadline is that week. (See Section “1:1s” for details)
4. Discuss finished experiments from last week and give the Experiment Owner 5 minutes per finished experiment to share learnings with the group.

# “1:1s”
These are held by the Growth Lead together with each member of the growth team on a monthly basis. First, the Growth Lead asks the Growth Team Member the provided list of questions (see below) and takes copious notes about the answers. It’s best to note down in the exact wordings of the person answering so that the Growth Team member feels addressed when their problems are being solved. Subsequently, the Growth Lead goes through all answers and works through the Growth Team member’s challenges together. Schedule one hour for this and adjust as you see fit for the phase of the process. For beginner Growth Hackers or fresh team members, you may schedule 1,5h or even 2h to account for longer explanations or deeper research tasks performed together in this meeting.

*Note: I write this in section a “you” format, speaking to the Growth Lead.*

## General Question List:

On a scale from 1-10, how clear is the Growth Hacking Process to you currently?

If lower than 10: What could I do to increase clarity here? → Let them answer and just write it down. You’ll get to the part where you help them later!

What was the most challenging experiment setup of the last month?

What was challenging about it?

How can I support you in the time we have today? → If necessary, add: “I could, for example, help you in conducting your research task of the month or help you in setting up an experiment or learning from a concluded experiment. “As the process progresses, remind team members of the fabulous resource that you are and of the many ways you can help them.

## Questions to add at the beginning of the quarter:

What’s one thing you want to learn this quarter?

How could you measure this learning? (Let them answer.) Let’s agree on this being your learning goal for this quarter?

What do you need from me/us/the company to support you in this learning goal? → Allow for any answers from conference tickets, books, online courses, mentoring sessions with external mentors, a team training for something specific,... then either commit to a support package on the spot or take notes and get back to them after discussing with HR or the CEO about resource allocation if it takes up time/budget.

**Check back at the end of the quarter:**

Did you fulfil your learning goal this quarter?

In 2 minutes, what did you learn?

What unexpected thing did you learn along the way?

## Mentoring

Note how all of these questions are there to give the Growth Team member the space to share their journey with you. This not only keeps you in touch with what’s happening, but more importantly it builds a connection and allows for collaboration between you. For those of you who have little leadership experience, it feels very good to be able to share struggles and wins with your Team Lead and get assistance in a given setting and without having to ask for it on a regular basis. It takes off the pressure of having to decide whether a problem or struggle is big enough to “interrupt” the Team Lead in the day-to-day happenings of business.

After asking all of these questions, it’s time to actually help them with what they answered earlier. Take your time and be a mentor. Be patient, the brain learns with repetition. If you don’t know something, be honest and get back to the Growth Team member with answers or let them find the answers/solutions and bring them to you at a later, agreed upon, point in time.

Afterwards, the Growth Lead appoints a Research Task for the next month to the team member and they designate a week in the upcoming month for that team member to do it. The deadline will then be the subsequent week’s Growth Meeting. This can be either deep research in an existing channel where experimentation has taken place (and it has been more than 3 months from the last Research Task) or a new channel that should be explored for experimentation in the near future.

Adapt this as makes sense in your company to either have the deadline of Research Tasks be with every 1:1 or a specific other date in the month. If it is important inside a team to share findings of Research Tasks with each other, you could call for a separate Research Task Learnings Share meeting. This has the advantage that Research Task methodologies can be shared with each other: meta-learning.

The herein proposed way to do it is to have one Growth Team member share a 2-minute summary of their findings and ideation in the Growth Meeting (see Growth Meeting Agenda above). Thus, a specific Growth Meeting date should be the deadline.

Remember: the Growth Lead is the mentor in this meeting and it’s their job to support the Growth Team member in what they’re building. if the mentee needs knowledge resources, help them find the right ones, if they need help analysing data, do it together, if they need help defining hypotheses (or doing any other part of the growth process, like getting the mindset right), the Growth Lead should help them do exactly that. Just like a CEO in a company, the Growth Lead is responsible to keep the Growth Hacking Process running smoothly, which entails technical work, as well as coaching to account for the human aspect of working as a company.
