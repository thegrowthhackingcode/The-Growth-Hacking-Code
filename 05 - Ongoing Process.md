# Research + Discovery
Research starts the Growth Hacking Process and keeps it going. To supercharge your growth, go really deep into researching every single experiment opportunity. We call this a Research Task and they are done for marketing, sales and product once per month. This way, we ensure that all areas of the Growth Funnel are well researched.

Research + Discovery can be split into two categories: researching external data and researching internal data. Both need to be done regularly. External data should be researched and explored when something new is attempted. Research benchmarks, competitive data - as  much as you can find. Feel free to be very creative in your research methodology and reach out to experts in the field, if you want to. Internal data should be studied continually, discovering growth potentials and learning about all business areas. After preparing the data in an orderly manner, you will be surprised about all the things it can tell you.

For each marketing, sales and product, there should be one Research Task conducted each month. It always needs to include internal and external research. What exactly is being researched should be decided by the Growth Lead according to the company’s goal(s) or overall strategy. The ongoing goal to explore what’s out there and even possibilities for successors of successful experiments will prove fundamental for supercharged growth.

## Channel Research
This needs to take place when opening up a new channel, or starting growth hacking on an existing one. It is important to start off with digging into what’s possible here. This goes in a couple steps.

Firstly, make sure you find out the potential of this funnel in general and then for your company in terms of your growth goal. This is external research.

If you already have a presence in a channel, analyze all previous efforts with a matter-of-fact attitude. This is not about judgement, but more about finding out what potential you can still tap into as a team. This is a mix of internal and external research.

Next, see what your competitors are doing in this channel and what you can learn from them. There are two paths to take here:

1. **Compete:** Go for the same strategy and do it better. Remember, where there is smoke there must be fire. If your competitors are doing it, it’s probably working.
2. **Blue Ocean:** Go for what your competitors are not yet doing. The hypothesis here is that you will be able to differentiate yourself from your competition in a way that makes you unique to your audience(s)/customers/users.

On a weekly basis, one Research Task must be performed by one of the team members. Decide whether this is right for you or at what point at implementing the Growth Hacking Process you are. In the beginning. You might do a lot of research in order to get started. Later, you might slow things down in this department when the team has had wins, is working hard and you have enough experiments in the Experiment Backlog. This is the variable to change when you need to provide room for some recovery and relaxation, mentally.

Also, alternate between researching existing channels or new ones. Make this depend on what your business needs and what your overall KPIs are. If you’re expanding to new markets with an existing product, new>existing channels. If you are looking to boost what you’re already doing because you have a feeling that there's some low hanging fruits you want to grab, existing>new channels. 

*Examples to get your thought process going:*

>*Website/Landing Page Analysis.*

>*Search Engine Analysis (technical SEO, keywords, competitors).*

>*Email marketing Analysis (content, demand, etc.).*

>*Online Community Analysis (platforms, barriers to entry, etc.).*

>*Direct sales Analysis (automation, CRM, competitors, etc.).*

>*Paid Channel Analysis (costs, mediums, competitors, audience sizes, targeting options, etc.).*

## Product Research, Customer Surveys and Market Study
This is research that relates to the product itself and does not necessarily involve any channel. Here, it is about sifting through data, watching user recordings if it’s a software product, observing customers and clients if it’s a physical product or service or actually conducting surveys or beta user groups. This involves existing internal data, as well as new internal data.

Feel free to go back to customer feedback you gained during the phase of product/service development. Also, check out what competitors are doing. Do trend analyses regarding what you find and see whether there are any new expectations arising in the market that you could tackle head-first.

In order for you to conduct this research, your existing customers need to answer questions and tell you things you cannot see in the data. marketing and sales will know how to conduct those in a meaningful and effective way.

# Experiment Definition
During and after the Research Tasks, you will start getting all sorts of ideas for what to try out to make growth happen. Good, that’s how it should be. Rather than going into a brainstorming and letting your creativity to a lot of guesswork, this is what data-driven strategic experiment generation is. By researching and ploughing through your own data, analysing every piece of information you can, you will begin to ask yourself some questions. Be scientific about this.

## Describe
When you have an idea, describe what this idea actually is. Write out the details of what you would change about something you are already doing to grow or something you would freshly set up.

## Hypothesise
This is my favorite word.

Write down your hypothesis in the following format:

**By [changing X], we can increase/decrease [metric Y].**

Examples:

> **By creating a landing page copy specifically focused on the speed of our SaaS, we can increase our conversion rate for demo signups by 10%.**

> **By adding a limited time offer to our retargeting ads, we can increase purchased hats by 20% from the traffic coming through this particular campaign.**

The hypothesis makes sure that you note down your original thought so that after the experiment is concluded, you can refer back to it to determine whether it was falsified or verified.

## Define a Threshold
In order to define what lift you need to get in your conversion rate or what impact the experiment really needs to have, you keep yourself on a short leash. Will you be happy with 2% increase in conversions? Or does it take something more dramatic like 15 or even 30% improvement? Remember that you really want to push the needle, so “increase conversions” is not precise enough. Make sure you also account for seasonal changes.

*Example: If August is a slow month for you, don’t expect sales to dramatically increase from July’s threshold. Look at your Year-Over-Year statistics, if you have them. Young companies - don’t listen, you’re still collecting data and that’s fine.*

## Prioritize
Give your experiment a score based on Impact, Confidence and Ease. This is the ICE-Score. Rate each element from 1 to 10, 10 being the best.

**Impact** aligns with your hypothesized goal and the threshold you put on it. This would get a 1 if it barely lifts off or retains the status quo in a new way. This would get a 10 if it suddenly doubles your sales in your highest life-time value customer segment.

**Confidence** is the certainty at which this experiment will be successful, as in: have the definend impact. This gets a 1 if you have no idea what will happen or have never heard of anyone doing this before. This gets a 10 if you didn’t only study many successful use cases but you have tried this successfully yourself before.

**Ease** implies how many resources (time, effort and people) the setup of this experiment will take. Programming a little tool to add to your website might require a programmer to be at work for a whole week and then collaborate with a UX designer to create a seamless experience (1 point), while setting up an A/B test might only require an hour or less (10 points).

# Data Work
After the initial base tracking, data consolidation and dashboard creation, tracking is to be reviewed and improved as the company grows.

## Data Collection Review
At least every quarterly meeting, discuss how tracking requirements of all of your business activities have changed and define what needs to be updated. If it’s time to migrate to a different tool(set) or try out different methods, do that. Define the things that need to be done and put them on the timeline for the upcoming quarter(s).

## Data Analysis
Check all of your channel data on a weekly basis and take notes. For experiments that include PPC, your paid traffic person should have an eye on them daily, of course.

This score should not be overthought. Just put in a score and enjoy the benefits. This isn’t set in stone, it simply is there to help you see which experiments to start with and which to keep for a later point.

# Learning
This is a big one that I haven’t seen anyone strategically break down so far as it relates to growth hacking, so this is one of my favorite parts about the Growth Hacking Process. This is a spectacular leadership opportunity and any CEO who doesn’t grab it is really missing out a key lever to pull for creating massive team happiness and job satisfaction.

The growth hacking agency that I worked for got this one really right when I joined the team. They made sure we always had some juicy learning sources to grow our area of expertise, as well as our areas of interest. In the beginning, I was trained to get better at copywriting and content marketing. I really felt mentored and was motivated. Although I was fresh to writing copy for ads, my Facebook ad copy converted highest from all of the team’s. It was a huge win for me.

⭐**Here’s the grand tip:** Create Learning Goals in line with the Growth Experiments that the team members want to try out. As the members of the Growth Team come up with ideas that they feel passionate about, it most often will reveal knowledge or skill gaps. What a wonderful time to let them fill those gaps! The worst thing that can happen is that you have a happy employee who was enabled by their employer to learn something new that didn’t prove valuable to the company’s growth. Even then, you can tick off that box and move on to the next idea to test without the regret of not having tried something new. The best case is that you have a happy employee who learned something new - again, enabled by you - AND it lead to growth within the company. How fantastic, now you’ve got someone who is passionate about their idea, brought it to life and can take the lead on teaching the rest of the team about that domain because chances are that the rest of the team has no clue about that expertise either. Also, you have an employee who knows they are supported throughout successes and failures, which are a natural and important part of the Growth Hacking Process (and life).

*Note: As I am more on the marketing and sales side of growth hacking, myself, I can recommend for the marketing Growth Team member to take a look at various T-Shaped Marketer models for inspiration on skills expansion. [Here’s one by Buffer from 2017](https://buffer.com/resources/t-shaped-marketer) and here’s [another version by The Growth Tribe from 2019](https://growthtribe.io/blog/t-shaped-marketer-2019/).*

*Request to you: Do you know any of these all-encompassing big picture models for product or Data Analytics? Write them down and submit a pull request! If they prove valuable, your adaptation will be included in this document!*
