# The Author

I am Julia Haitzmann, a Growth Hacker from Vienna, Austria. I wrote this document in an attempt to fill in the gaps about growth hacking knowledge that is out there today. With my experience in working for a growth hacking agency and subsequently becoming an independent contractor, I have always been on a quest to fill in the gaps for myself. In this document, I share what I have found to lay the groundwork for a new era.

# The Goal Of This Document

In growth hacking, there has to be a goal for every action you take. I wouldn’t feel like myself not pointing out to you the goal of this document. This document aims to bring clarity. It also aims at being a step by step guide and an owner’s manual to the Growth Hacking Process, as it is called here. What it also aims to do is to fill in any knowledge gaps that came up in practice - that others are experiencing most likely, too.

As this is an open source document, feel free to submit any suggested changes via a pull request.

# A Guide To This Document

It’s thrilling to have you reading this. For your orientation, we will approach the process of growth hacking in the following way.

We will talk about what growth hacking is not and bust a couple of myths. A lot of questions will be answered at that point and you’ll likely have developed new ones by the end of that section. We will then go into the necessary requirements for what a company needs in order to start a Growth Hacking Process.

In this work, I will refer to the (as I like to call it) Growth Hacking Process, not a one-time win. It takes most companies months of experimenting with “hacks” to actually be successful. Running it as a process is also the only way to make it replicable for other companies like yours. Takes the pressure off and gives you a simple-to-follow structure for what to do when. You’re welcome.

**PART I:** The Teachings of Great Growth Hackers
Here, you learn about the big teachers who lay down the groundwork for the Growth Hacking Process. First, you must know what the AAARRR Funnel is. After this, you will gain awareness on the so-called North Star Metric.

**PART II:** Implementing the Growth Hacking Process
In order to run a data-driven process like growth hacking, you need proper data collection, manipulation and reporting. Also, you need to set up a proper Growth Team. Here, we will talk about who to recruit and what positions need to be internally filled. Next, we get into the ongoing process and what that entails.

Subsequently, the nitty gritty is up. As well as understanding meeting structures (again, leaning on the great teachings of the ones that have created the basework for the Growth Hacking Process), we help you manage expectations with a process timeline.

# Who Is The Growth Hacking Code For

With its length and depth of exploration, this is for those who know nothing to those who know a fair amount and anyone in between who is confused with the whole subject of growth hacking. It is also for those who have tried it and failed at implementing it. In fact, it is especially for the latter. If you are one of these people, I would like you to tell me about your experience and what happened exactly. Please email me at [link](mailto:julia@thegrowthhackingcode.com).

Keep reading if you are either interested in general and have the time to spare to read this (roughly) 25-page document or if you are a C-level person in an organization that has reached product-market fit and are not happy with your growth rate.
