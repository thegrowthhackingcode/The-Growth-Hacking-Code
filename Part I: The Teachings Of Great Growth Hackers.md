# Growth Hacking Principles
## Ground Rules
Purists will love this.

1. What we cannot measure, we do not do.
2. Define a hypothesis for everything you want to try. Or: Write your ideas down as hypotheses.
3. Expose all assumptions that you‚Äôre making. Question everything. Speak in assumptions and ideas neutrally and give them a chance to prove themselves in real life.
4. Growth hacking is a learning process. (If other objectives are above learning within the company, growth hacking is not for you.)
5. We learn to fail. We fail in order to learn.
6. We collaborate to reach goals at all times. (These two must go hand-in-hand. On their own, they are dangerous.)
7. Each person must be responsible for their own set of goals and experiment and if there‚Äôs an experiment that relates to their individual goal set, they must be the owner, otherwise there will be free riders and confusion. Collaboration needs to be at the heart of company goals, as cross-functional collaboration allows for the whole to be greater than the sum of its parts.

## Growth Hacking Funnel
This funnel exists as a sort of customer journey. Some of you may be familiar with sales funnels, sales stages, marketing stages,.... Welcome to the Growth Funnel that includes all relevant company activities in a simple model. Again, this shared funnel will force departments to collaborate. Roughly stated Awareness, Acquisition and Activation are all marketing and sales activities. Pre-Revenue Retention, Revenue and Post-Revenue Retention are the product team‚Äôs responsibilities. Referral is a mix. See who does what in your company so far and whether you even cover all steps properly so far.

**Awareness**

At this stage a person is aware of your brand, your company or your offer. They saw you or heard of you somewhere. You‚Äôve come to their attention in some way.

**Acquisition**

Here, the person has come onto one of your properties. Be it a website, a physical shop of yours or even when this person slips into a conversation with someone from your company. You have acquired them and can now decide what you tell them.

**Activation**

This is the stage where a person takes the first initial action and you establish some sort of potential buyer relationship with them. The sign up to your free trial, they have requested a piece of content and signed up using their email address or they‚Äôve inquired about your offer. You have given them enough information of the right sort and amount to help them make the decision to interact with you in some way.

**Pre-Revenue Retention**

This stage does not exist in every business. This phase arose first in SaaS businesses with freemium models. That‚Äôs where it‚Äôs time to make sure the person loves what you offer them for free so much that you convince them to give you money for the premium feature. It need not be said that there will be disproportionately many free riders in this stage and you‚Äôre trying to sift out your true potential buyers. In non-SaaS businesses, this stage could be actively consuming free content or making sure that the path to buying is free - whatever that is. Before they buy, they have something they can get or consume from you. 

**Revenue**

A person buys your product, subscribes to your paid service or receives your paid service.

**Post-Revenue Retention**

You make them a returning customer or retain them in a monthly model.

**Referral**

The person loves your company, offer or brand so much that they refer you to colleagues, friends and family.

*The only thing I added to this existing model was the differentiation between Pre- and Post-Revenue Retention.*

## The North Star Metric
This is your ultimate value creation metric. This metric (ideally) pulls together all other metrics and no, it should definitely not be measured in currency.

The famous examples are Airbnb‚Äôs nights sold via their platform and Facebook‚Äôs daily active users. [Here‚Äôs](https://blog.growthhackers.com/what-is-a-north-star-metric-b31a8512923f) a fantastic resource by Sean Ellis himself, so we will not go into more detail here.

# Preparation

The following steps need to be taken care of before starting the Growth Hacking Process.

## Data Work
Everything we do needs to be measured - remember: ‚ÄúWhat we cannot measure, we do not do.‚Äù That‚Äôs why it is of utmost importance to have accurate and orderly tracking in place. Every piece of effort put into tracking is an investment that will yield you tenfold return. Accurate: you do not want any lost or missing data. Orderly: you also don‚Äôt want a data jungle where different categories of data mix up and mislead you to making incorrect assumptions or draw false conclusions. Nothing worse than the hypothesis of an experiment mistakenly verified or falsified. üòñ All points of contact with your company or brand should be tracked in every way and cohesively put together in one data suite. If you can afford it, hire a data scientist. If you are a smaller company, train someone (anyone in your company) to do it or have the Growth Lead be an expert at it and develop a solution specifically for your company. 

Once you have proper tracking in place, let that run with your regular daily business for as long as possible, at least one month or season. In B2B, proper data can start being extracted after at least 2 sales cycles have passed. The more data, the merrier.

At this point, all department heads need to come together and are responsible for the tracking in their respective field. Whether it‚Äôs the department heads ending up in the Growth Team or not (which we will get to in a moment), they need to hold full accountability for this step.

### Tracking: Data Collection
It starts with tracking, where you make sure that every single point of interaction of any human being is tracked in as much detail as possible. This helps not only to quantify what is happening but - sometimes in combination with some qualitative data - can deliver insights worth millions. Before you find something, you‚Äôll never know it would one day turn out to be an important metric to track.

Track everything you can. With a minimum amount of spending and a medium amount of effort, it is possible to combine customers‚Äô data across all touchpoints.

Things to think about:

**Marketing** ‚Üí comprehensive webtracking, conversion tracking from all marketing campaigns

**Sales** ‚Üí a proper CRM that includes all interactions had and the people from the team that they had them with, all relevant data about the person and/or company, all interactions with your website or other trackable places that belong to you (online or offline)

**Product** ‚Üí comprehensive product tracking, among which are interactions with your product or service, use of features, requests (possible or impossible), attempts at using the product/service in ways that you hadn‚Äôt thought of, happiness with the product

### Consolidating Data

Now that you are tracking data in all areas of your business, it‚Äôs necessary to consolidate and correlate data points. You need software to detect if it‚Äôs a previous customer or a first-time visitor who is scrolling through your landing page and converting. Had they previously talk to someone from your team at an event or a trade show? Or had they been targeted with some Facebook ads? If this is not the first time on one of your landing pages, what other web properties had they previously visited? If that‚Äôs not enough to get you realizing the importance of this, here‚Äôs more: You want to combine how many times someone visited your website before they called, how many times they called, whether they interacted with one of your support team members via a website chat or not, at what time they bought how much of your product/service, their lifetime value, how many friends they referred and who they referred. You want to know whether customers with high lifetime value were the ones that came through your blog and how long it took them to make the decision to buy from you. The list goes on. Track as much as you possibly can. You get it.

Subjective (and hopefully relevant) Note: I‚Äôve seen a lot of companies budgeting ridiculous amounts of money for huge campaigns but don‚Äôt see the point in tracking any of it. If you have any marketing budget at all and you‚Äôre not spending it on data collection and consolidation, please reconsider the path of growth hacking all together.

### Dashboards
Design KPI dashboards for each area of your business that can be accessed by your entire team. Let them all see how the company is doing. This sets you up for success also in the growth hacking ideation process. They are there for everyone to feel in the loop about what‚Äôs going on. It also helps build or fuel a results-based company culture. Lastly, it allows for each individual to see the effects of their activities right there in the numbers. It‚Äôs trust-building and generates a lot of ideas.
