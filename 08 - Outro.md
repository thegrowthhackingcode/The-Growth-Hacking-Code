Embarking on this journey is a big thing. Don’t take it lightly.

If you need help with any of this, feel free to email me at julia@thegrowthhackingcode.com or visit www.thegrowthhackingcode.com and sign up to receive updates as we might launch a product or service once we’ve conducted our market study. Also, we will be releasing templates and extra resources to support you in every step of the way on the website, too. I’m a process lover, so of course I’ve created my own workflows and templates. I’ll happily share those with you.

We have not reached product-market-fit with this ourselves yet, so we’re in product development phase - with you. Again, feel free to comment or give feedback on this document, and submit pull requests as you please.

I’m glad that you read this far in the document (or skipped to the end). Now go and implement what you learned here!
