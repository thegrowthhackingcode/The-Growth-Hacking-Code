# Ground Rules
Purists will love this.

1. What we cannot measure, we do not do.
2. Define a hypothesis for everything you want to try. Or: Write your ideas down as hypotheses.
3. Expose all assumptions that you’re making. Question everything. Speak in assumptions and ideas neutrally and give them a chance to prove themselves in real life.
4. Growth hacking is a learning process. (If other objectives are above learning within the company, growth hacking is not for you.)
5. We learn to fail. We fail in order to learn.
6. We collaborate to reach goals at all times. (These two must go hand-in-hand. On their own, they are dangerous.)
7. Each person must be responsible for their own set of goals and experiment and if there’s an experiment that relates to their individual goal set, they must be the owner, otherwise there will be free riders and confusion. Collaboration needs to be at the heart of company goals, as cross-functional collaboration allows for the whole to be greater than the sum of its parts.

# Growth Hacking Funnel
This funnel exists as a sort of customer journey. Some of you may be familiar with sales funnels, sales stages, marketing stages,.... Welcome to the Growth Funnel that includes all relevant company activities in a simple model. It was first called the [Startup Metrics by Dave McClure](https://www.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/startup-metrics-for-pirates-long-version) and used as it is before [Growth Tribe went ahead and made the 5 steps into 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDSrlyBVfE). Again, this shared funnel will force departments to collaborate. Roughly stated Awareness, Acquisition and Activation are all marketing and sales activities. Pre-Revenue Retention, Revenue and Post-Revenue Retention are the product team’s responsibilities. Referral is a mix. See who does what in your company so far and whether you even cover all steps properly so far.

**Awareness**

At this stage a person is aware of your brand, your company or your offer. They saw you or heard of you somewhere. You’ve come to their attention in some way.

**Acquisition**

Here, the person has come onto one of your properties. Be it a website, a physical shop of yours or even when this person slips into a conversation with someone from your company. You have acquired them and can now decide what you tell them.

**Activation**

This is the stage where a person takes the first initial action and you establish some sort of potential buyer relationship with them. The sign up to your free trial, they have requested a piece of content and signed up using their email address or they’ve inquired about your offer. You have given them enough information of the right sort and amount to help them make the decision to interact with you in some way.

**Pre-Revenue Retention**

This stage does not exist in every business. This phase arose first in SaaS businesses with freemium models. That’s where it’s time to make sure the person loves what you offer them for free so much that you convince them to give you money for the premium feature. It need not be said that there will be disproportionately many free riders in this stage and you’re trying to sift out your true potential buyers. In non-SaaS businesses, this stage could be actively consuming free content or making sure that the path to buying is free - whatever that is. Before they buy, they have something they can get or consume from you. 

**Revenue**

A person buys your product, subscribes to your paid service or receives your paid service.

**Post-Revenue Retention**

You make them a returning customer or retain them in a monthly model.

**Referral**

The person loves your company, offer or brand so much that they refer you to colleagues, friends and family.

*The only thing I added to this existing model was the differentiation between Pre- and Post-Revenue Retention.*

# The North Star Metric
This is your ultimate value creation metric. This metric (ideally) pulls together all other metrics and no, it should definitely not be measured in currency.

The famous examples are Airbnb’s nights sold via their platform and Facebook’s daily active users. [Here’s](https://blog.growthhackers.com/what-is-a-north-star-metric-b31a8512923f) a fantastic resource by Sean Ellis himself, so we will not go into more detail here.
