After becoming fully tracked or during the process, a Growth Team needs to be formed. This Growth Team is made up of four distinctive roles. In smaller startups, multiple roles are fulfilled by the same person, therefore multiple growth positions will also be filled by the same person. The Growth Team will evolve both in the number of members, as well as in the overall skillset and knowledge depth on account of each individual. growth hacking is the connecting point between product, marketing & sales and data analytics. It will be no surprise that each area needs to be represented in a Growth Team for efforts to really take effect. (Yet, many miss this part.)

# Growth Lead
The person leading the Growth Team will be called the Growth Lead. The role of this person is to guide the team through the Growth Hacking Process and adapt it where it is necessary. This person’s goal is to make and keep the process simple and orderly.

It can be the CEO themselves or someone strongly backed by the CEO, even if Growth Experiments don’t prove successful at times (especially in the beginning, when everything gets started).

Their responsibilities are:

* define growth metrics together with the CEO (if it is not the CEO herself) and set numerical goals for the North Star Metric or the Growth Funnel metrics to be reached
* appoint Growth Team members
* mentor each Growth Team member in the process and help them achieve their goals by
  * holding monthly 1:1s with them to assist them in their particular area of expertise and goals (more on that later)
  * guiding them in their learning process
  * providing them with necessary external resources (knowledge through courses, books, events or external people) if needed
  * assisting them in making data-driven decisions
  * taking in their feedback and ideas
* present learnings and conclusions to the rest of the company in a clear and easily readable manner
  * together with the data analyst, the Growth Lead helps create the growth hacking dashboard that everyone in the company has access to
* lead the Growth Meetings

The Growth Lead is to be determined first. She will then go on to recruiting all other Growth Team members from within the company, hiring either the department heads, a person strongly backed by their respective department head, or even both, if multiple people from the same department have the time and resources to participate in the Process.

# Members from the Company

## Product Development
Sean Ellis talks about the perfect moment to start growth hacking being the moment you are sure you have a “must-have product”. It is thus at the point when product development has succeeded to a point where product-market-fit is achieved that the growth hacking Team can start setting up the Growth Hacking Process. The product person must have the power and skillset to actually make changes to the product or service with minimal help. If your company is a SaaS company, for example, this should be the product owner and/or a programmer from the product team. If you are in the service industry, it must be the person in charge of service processes or client fulfilment. A product development person assures the following things within the Growth Team:

* with all learnings from the product development process, the Growth Team can hit the ground running
* experiments requiring significant product changes can be conducted
* the people who have built (at least part of) the product or service that is being offered by the company have absolutely fantastic ideas that will actually make it into the Growth Hacking Process

## Tech-Savvy Marketing & Sales
marketing is in fact the task of bringing a product or service to market and sales is about closing, said simply. In growth hacking, however, marketing and sales are only two parts of the whole picture. Here, we enter the domain of branding, communication, client relationships, point of sales, pricing, etc. The marketing and sales Growth Team member(s) are one, two or more people of the Growth Team.

I have combined marketing and sales as one point because often times the marketing department is held accountable for sales metrics or there is an appointed Head of marketing & sales, even in larger companies that could afford two separate positions.

If your business has any presence whatsoever on the internet - and let’s be honest, which business doesn’t, the marketing and sales person/people must be tech-savvy. We live in a world where not knowing how the internet and technology works will keep you from running a successful Growth Hacking Process, simply because a business that is not online or otherwise making massive use of technology will have an exponentially harder time than one that is. If the Head of marketing/sales is not tech-savvy themselves, they must provide a tech-savvy person who’s ideas and decisions they will back, even if they fail.

Having a tech-savvy marketing, as well as a sales person in the Growth Teams makes sure that:

* marketing channel opportunities are captured and fully exploited
* communication in words, as well as rich media is of high quality and has a broad range
* experiments can go all the way into the expression of branding and slogans
* all existing content can be fully utilized and content creation efforts can be steered in a way where they throw off a couple experiment-worthy pieces every now and then, fueling new ideas and hypotheses

## Data Analytics Specialist
The larger the company, the more likely it is that this will be hired as a full-time position on its own. Until then, it can be covered by any of the other people or the CEO themselves. This person will allow for:

* regular tackling of tracking tasks and issues
* proper presentation of data in dashboards and KPIs for the whole team to monitor their efforts and where the company is at (this has a magical effect of unifying the team for goal-driven activities and collaboration)

# Responsibilities of All Growth Hacking Team Members
All team members are to:

* regularly contribute ideas to the growth hacking idea backlog (we will get to this)
* contribute individually and collaboratively
* take full ownership over the goals of their expertise / department
* collaborate with others who need help reaching their goals
* clearly communicate insights and findings that come up from any kind of research, data analysis or in daily business
* maintain the clean and clear status of the growth hacking Idea and Project Management Base (check for the Airtable template soon to be released via thegrowthhackingcode.com)

# A Note On Agencies
Growth hacking is an inside job. While bringing in external resources and knowledge, in general, is sometimes a necessary option, it should not be the default option. growth hacking is a learning process and you want learnings about your company to be **inside** of your company. If you decide to work with a growth hacking agency - or any other agency, for that matter - make sure you do it in order to kickstart new ideas and bring the expertise into your business so that it is sustainable and you harness its full potential. Or involve them in your business so much that they become long-term partners and feel like the addition of a remote team **within** your organization.
