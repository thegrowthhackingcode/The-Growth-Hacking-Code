# What Growth Hacking is Not

Before we start, it is important to know what growth hacking is not.

## Growth Hacking is Not A Scam

Lots of myths, my favorite being statements like “Growth Hacking is a Scam” have come up about this topic and thus it’s important to get that out of the way. This document will break down one of the most sustainable and resource-effective methods for enabling company growth in surprisingly easy ways. However, if such a framework is not followed, the attempt at growth hacking can quickly turn into a very dark nightmare and a huge disappointment. And then, well, you’ll go on to writing an article just like [A (Stealth) Research on the Scam Behind Growth Marketing Agencies](https://www.growthsandwich.com/resources/the-scam-behind-growth-hacking-agencies/), [2016 Is Almost Over and Growth Hacking Is Still Bullshit](https://medium.com/startup-foundation-stories/2016-is-almost-over-and-growth-hacking-is-still-bullshit-7c164ee4f247) or [Growth hacking is bullshit](https://www.intercom.com/blog/growth-hacking-is-bullshit/).

## Growth Hacking is Not Operational Business

It is tempting to think that growth hacking would replace marketing, sales or product development. Let’s get into each of those.

When a company first starts, it needs to do so with a product. A company that starts out without a repeatable, scalable and profitable business model and instead with an idea and a bunch of hypotheses regarding this idea is called a startup - a temporary organization in search of this business model. A startup has yet to find a business model and is focussing all efforts (hopefully) on finding product-market-fit. Every business that has a product or service to offer, one that people buy repeatedly for whatever reason, is no longer a startup. It is often overlooked, but this second type of businesses also still have product development to do. In fact, they should be working primarily on developing their product so that it becomes what Sean Ellis calls a “must-have product”. Both types of businesses have the main objective of building a business model that works around a must-have product or service. growth hacking is not a substitute for this kind of product development. growth hacking will not make an unnecessary product a must-have. It can help, but it’s not guaranteed. Instead, that needs to be ensured by the founder and product team before the growth experimentation flow is turned on.

Alongside product development, the company needs to be continually offering and selling their product or service so that they can get live market and customer feedback. This kind of lean and agile development is the state-of-the-art methodology to build something fast and allows for the perfect company culture basis for a growth team to come in. This is ensured by the “fail fast, learn fast” approach that is identical in growth hacking. Similar to the lean development method, growth hacking is about taking lots of little steps and coming to conclusions whether something works or not quickly. What growth hacking will not do is **define a brand and nurture a customer basis** over a long period of time. It is not about slowly building something that will be a long-term asset or running the daily operations of marketing and sales. That is the sales and marketing team’s job. In order to market and sell a product, the first communication channels must be established to reach potential customer groups. This can and should happen in conjunction with product development.

## Growth Hacking is Not An Outside Job

I do not support the belief that growth hacking the way it was originally coined by Sean Ellis can ever be something that an agency can provide for a company. Would you agree, (tag Sean Ellis) How should an agency make product adaptations or develop new features? When it comes to marketing, it has been proven that that may be carried out successfully as an outside job for some companies. If you are a company that wants to implement growth hacking and you have a marketing agency doing most of your marketing, however, they’re in for a treat because they are about to get involved in one of your most important inside jobs.

Growth hacking brings together data, product, marketing and sales along the Growth Funnel. It is about interdisciplinary collaboration where the whole will be much greater than the sum of its parts. The best effect an outside growth hacking agency could have on a company’s growth is teach a team how to interpret data or temporarily fill in their lack of marketing or product development skill. The very best thing an outside growth hacking agency could do for a company, in my opinion, is to teach them how to collaborate on rapid growth experimentation themselves. This is also the objective of this document.

# What Makes A Company Ready For Growth Hacking - Questions To Ask Yourselves

**Does your product/service have product-market-fit and do you have a small (or large) user base / customer base that proves it?**
If your product or service is not really a must-have, you are not ready for growth. Bringing in new potential users/customers would not be a good idea. If you’re not sure that a significant amount of people latch on when they find out about your product or service, save yourself the money and the effort. Continue working on your offer until it hits a sweet spot: 40% of your users need to feel disappointed if your company no longer offered what it currently does. 

**If you had 10, 100, 10.000 or 1.000.000 new customers tomorrow, could you handle it?**
If not, you’re not ready for growth and it’s time to build out your company structure first. You should have all necessary procedures and timely resources, as well as people filling the basic positions, ready before you potentially find a growth lever that will bring in a surge of new customers. Or have a dang good plan (or process - see the theme here?) in place for how to level up rapidly when that happens.

**Would making a mistake cost you more than not trying anything new at all?**
If your company culture is not ready for your Growth Team to make mistakes, growth hacking is not for you. 90% of all experiments will fail. If every time a mistake is made, an ego gets hurt so much or a C-level gets so worried that it impedes all other productivity, don’t pursue the endeavor.

**Do we have a brand / a “why” / a vision and mission?**
A brand is just another way of saying everyone’s onto something bigger than just business and they feel it and know it. The founder(s), the team, the customers, the suppliers. Brands evolve as a result of the founders’ actions and attitudes. Whether they have been put into writing or not. Every successful company has a great brand. Great leaders put them into writing sooner or later. The Growth Hacking Code is made for such companies that know what they do, how they do it and - most importantly - why they do it.

# Positive Side-Effects of Growth Hacking

## Growth Hacking will De-Silo Your Company

It’s fantastic at doing that. Most likely, collaboration issues that have been dormant because purposely avodied so far will come to the surface. How fortunate that there’s a structured approach to overcome these inner obstacles.

## Excitement in the Team

Having the power to realize and being the owner of the realizations of your ideas is immensely satisfying as an employee.

## Supercharged Learning

You’ll learn more about your own business model than you thought possible in a very short amount of time.
